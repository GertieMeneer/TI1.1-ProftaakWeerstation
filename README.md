# Major Project "Weatherstation"
Created by me, https://github.com/Maersel and 3 other students

## Project Description
- This was the start of my first year in school. We started learning basic Java. It's definently visible in the code lol.
- School had a server running which logged measurements from a weather station. We were given a UI made in Java with buttons, 7-digit numbers and a dot-matrix display.
- We had to write code so we could make a basic UI for a user which was going to use the weather station.
- You could view all data (wind speed, humidity, etc) and this project also involved making our own functionality using a lot of data to calculate some other value.
